# rogue_eft_old

Hey everybody, Buddy / Braxton here, owner of rogue.rip.
Though the site has been very on and off for almost a decade now, I finally have more time to recode and revive the project.
In doing so, I've decided to publicize some old test builds, that are not the best, but may help some people learn certain game engines. 

NOTE that the builds I release are meant for DEBUGGING and TESTING.
I will not include any version of my driver, driver framework, usermode framework, or release overlay.
Included is the usermode project and a testing NVidia overlay only.
You will be banned if you use this without changing anything.
This project is for getting familiar with Unity's mono-compiled games, this is NOT a cheat.

If you have any questions feel free to email me at admin@rogue.rip

#Code notes:
#-PascalCase is meant to represent EFT / Unity functions
#-Offsets appear hardcoded as a build server adds most of them to project files via a script, sorry about that
#-Compiled in Visual C++, C17, C++ Preview
