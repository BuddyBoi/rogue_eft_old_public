# rogue_eft_old

Hey everybody, Buddy / Braxton here, owner of rogue.rip.
Though the site has been very on and off for almost a decade now, I finally have more time to recode and revive the project.
In doing so, I've decided to publicize some old test builds, that are not the best, but may help some people learn certain game engines. 

NOTE that the builds I release are meant for DEBUGGING and TESTING.
I will not include any version of my driver, driver framework, usermode framework, or release overlay.
Included is the usermode project and a testing NVidia overlay only.
You will be banned if you use this without changing anything.
This project is for getting familiar with Unity's mono-compiled games, this is NOT a cheat.

Edit 6/8/23 : I've decided to slowly update and maintain this project, turning it into a complete usermode version of an open-source EFT External. Feel free to ask questions or request committs as you please.

If you have any questions feel free to email me at admin@rogue.rip or my discord at : buddy#3823.
